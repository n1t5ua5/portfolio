# My Digital Portfolio

## Introduction

This portfolio highlights various projects I've built primarily using: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, php, Python, Java, MySQL, SQL, MongoDB & more. Originally designed in 2022 & hosted via Pair; I've updated it ever since, including most recently in 2025 when I finally gave it a home here on GitHub + I added a link to YouTube in the footer which contains demos for all the projects listed below.
