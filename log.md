# Portfolio Edit Log

I should've started this a lot sooner to document all of the changes I've made over the years, especially in regards to the logic implemented in Main.js, but I suppose now is better than never. I'm not writing this as a direct criticism to myself, but more so as a reminder that I need to start these sorts of things at the beginning of projects as opposed to once their finished so I can use it for future reference if needed. I will probably dismantle this site within two years or so & build another portfolio, depending on the amount of free time I have, but until then this works fine & the hosting that's done via Pair is relatively cheap. The last noticeable changes I made to the live site were done yesterday on 8/11/25 & recorded in my usual code journal (link below) which emcompasses all the projects I work on so I won't repeat it again here for the sake of brevity, but the only future alterations that I already know I want to make (outside of adding new projects) is tidying up the CSS & grouping some properties together to reduce redundancies & save some more space. Until next time & thanks for reading!
